# Create the Hub Network

The following will be created:
* Resource Group for Hub Neworking (hub-networking.tf)
* Hub Network (hub-networking.tf)
* Azure Firewall (firewall.tf)
* Azure Bastion Host (hub-networking.tf)
* Virtual Machine (dev-setup.tf)



Navigate to "/Scenarios/AKS-Secure-Baseline-PrivateCluster/Terraform/04-Network-Hub" folder
```
cd ../04-Network-Hub
```

In the "variables.tf" file, update the defaults to reflect the tags  you'd like to use throughout the rest of the deployment.  There are a group of "sensitive" variables for the username and password of the jumpbox.  It is not recommended that these variables be commited to code in a public repo, you should instead create a separate terraform.tfvars file (not committed via gitignore) or use GitHub secrets (with a workflow) to pass those values in at deployment time. (A sample terraform.tfvars.sample file is included for reference. Enter your values and rename it **terraform.tfvars**)

Once the files are updated, deploy using Terraform Init, Plan and Apply. 

```bash
terraform init -backend-config="resource_group_name=$TFSTATE_RG" -backend-config="storage_account_name=$STORAGEACCOUNTNAME" -backend-config="container_name=$CONTAINERNAME"
```

> Enter terraform init -reconfigure if you get an error saying there was a change in the backend configuration which may require migrating existing state

```bash
terraform plan
```

```bash
terraform apply
```

If you get an error about changes to the configuration, go with the `-reconfigure` flag option.
