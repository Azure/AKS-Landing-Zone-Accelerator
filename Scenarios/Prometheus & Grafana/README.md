# Enable Prometheus metric collection & integration with Azure Managed Grafana

## Introduction

- This guidance helps in configuring your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to send data to Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. 

- This will also help in creation of Azure Managed Grafana workspace to link with Azure workspace  


## Prerequisites to create Azure Monitor workspace

- The cluster must use [managed identity authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview).
- The following resource providers must be registered in the subscription of the AKS cluster and the Azure Monitor Workspace.
  - Microsoft.ContainerService
  - Microsoft.Insights
  - Microsoft.AlertsManagement
- Register the AKS-PrometheusAddonPreview feature flag in the Azure Kubernetes clusters subscription with the following command in Azure CLI: az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AKS-PrometheusAddonPreview.
- The aks-preview extension needs to be installed using the command az extension add --name aks-preview. 
- Azure CLI version 2.41.0 or higher is required for this feature. Aks-preview version 0.5.122 or higher is required for this feature. You can check the aks-preview version using the az version command.


> Important : Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus is intended for storing information about service health of customer machines and applications. It is not intended for storing any data classified as Personal Identifiable Information (PII) or End User Identifiable Information. We strongly recommend that you do not send any sensitive information (usernames, credit card numbers etc.) into Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus fields like metric names, label names, or label values
For more details , refer https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview

## Enable Prometheus metric collection

> Login into Azure CLI  

```bash
  az login
```

> Update Subscription

```bash
  az account set --subscription "subscription-id"
```

> Register Feature

```bash
  az feature register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService --name AKS-PrometheusAddonPreview
```

> Add preview-extension

```bash
  az extension add --name aks-preview
```

> Create a new default Azure Monitor workspace. If no Azure Monitor Workspace is specified, then a default Azure Monitor Workspace will be created in the DefaultRG-<cluster_region> following the format DefaultAzureMonitorWorkspace-<mapped_region>. This Azure Monitor Workspace will be in the region specific in Region mappings.

```bash
  az aks update --enable-azuremonitormetrics -n <cluster-name> -g <cluster-resource-group>
```

OR

> Use an existing Azure Monitor workspace. If the Azure Monitor workspace is linked to one or more Grafana workspaces, then the data will be available in Grafana.

```bash
az aks update --enable-azuremonitormetrics -n <cluster-name> -g <cluster-resource-group> --azure-monitor-workspace-resource-id <workspace-name-resource-id>
```

## Add Azure Managed Grafana service

> Prerequisites
- Azure Subscription
- Minimum required role to create an instance: resource group Contributor (Owner role is recommended since it's needed to assign users or groups to built-in Grafana roles)
- Minimum required role to access an instance: Grafana Viewer

> Implementation

1. Create an Azure Managed Grafana workspace

```bash
az grafana create --name <managed-grafana-resource-name> --resource-group <resourcegroupname>
```

**Note:** that Azure Managed Grafana workspace is available only in specific regions. Before deployment, please choose an appropriate region.

Now letâ€™s check if you can access your new Managed Grafana instance. Take note of the endpoint URL ending in grafana.azure.com, as displayed in the CLI output. Open a browser and navigate to this URL. If you have the right permissions, you will see the the Grafana application homepage.

For more information on this, check out the documentation on [Create an Azure Managed Grafana instance using the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-cli)

**Note:** Azure Managed Grafana does not support connecting with personal Microsoft accounts currently. Please refer for additional information https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/quickstart-managed-grafana-cli.

## Connect Grafana and Prometheus managed services

[Azure Managed Grafana](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) provides rich visualization of Prometheus data. It's designed to work seamlessly with Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Connect your managed Grafana instance to your Azure monitor workspace by following the instructions in [Connect your Azure Monitor workspace to a Grafana workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage?tabs=azure-portal#link-a-grafana-workspace).

> Below are the steps to complete this:

- Open the Azure Monitor workspace menu in the Azure portal
- Select your workspace
- Click "Linked Grafana workspaces"
- Select a Grafana workspace

After setting this up, you can access multiple prebuilt dashboards with Prometheus metrics and customize these dashboards and/or create new ones.

## Deploying Grafana and Monitor Workspace for Prometheus using Terraform

Azure Monitor Workspace for Prometheus is a new service (in preview).
It is not yet supported with ARM template or with Terraform resource.

So, we'll use (`azapi`) terraform provider to create the Monitor Workspace for Prometheus.

And we'll use a `local-exec` to run a command line to configure AKS with Prometheus.

AKS, Grafana and Log Analytics are supported with ARM templates and Terraform.

### Deploying the resources using Terraform

To deploy the Terraform configuration files, run the following commands:

```shell
terraform init

terraform plan -out tfplan

terraform apply tfplan
```

### Cleanup resources

To delete the creates resources, run the following command:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
