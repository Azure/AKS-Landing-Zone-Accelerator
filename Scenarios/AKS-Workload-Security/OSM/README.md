# Open Service Mesh AKS add-on

The [Open Service Mesh AKS add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/open-service-mesh-about) is well documented on how to install and/or enable the AKS add-on, as well as how to deploy a sample application or onboard an existing application. Please review the following links to get started securing your AKS workloads with Open Service Mesh.

## Installation

[Install the Open Service Mesh add-on by using the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/open-service-mesh-deploy-addon-az-cli)

## Deploy a Sample Application

To get further acquainted on how Open Service Mesh can secure your workload communications, you can deploy the test Bookstore application in your AKS cluster.

The [Deploy Sample Applications](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/getting_started/install_apps/) documentation on the [openservicemesh.io](openservicemesh.io) site will walk you through deploying the sample Bookstore applications and applying various traffic policies.

## Onboarding Applications to OSM

If you have existing applications workloads deployed in your AKS cluster, Open Service Mesh can be deployed to secure your workload communications.

The [Application Onboarding](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/app_onboarding/) provides guidance on how to onboard your application to the mesh as well as understanding the different types of traffic policies your application may need.

## Additional OSM Resources

In addition to learning about OSM by deploying the sample application and onboarding your existing application workloads, the OSM documentation containers additional information on how-to guidance as well as other project integrations, such as [Dapr's](dapr.io) microservices API framework, [Prometheus'](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring, and [Flagger's](https://fluxcd.io/flagger/) progressive delivery tool.

To view all of OSM's how-to and integrations documentation, please visit the [OSM How-to Guides](https://docs.openservicemesh.io/docs/guides/) link for additional information.
